Converts Beat Saber maps into OSU! maps.

I included a run.bat which launches the thing, but obviously it requires you to install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Launch it, select the beat saber map file (.zip), and it will generate OSU! file (.osz) next to it and close. 

I made this so that I could use beat sage without owning beat saber.

There are no sliders or anything, converted beatmaps are literally copies of beat saber beatmaps but in osu.
